CosmosEngine - A Unity3D All-In-One Mobile Game Develop Framework
============

## Design Origin
For a experienced developer, develop a new game is depressing.They should pull their old code from their previous projects and refactor them.If they have a some bad code in them, Pull Old Code will become a terrible job.

For a game develop newbie, develop a new game is destress. They should construct the project's base code from the beginning.

So develop framework was borned. There are thousands of Web Develop Framework to help you develop a MVC style web application, but a few game develop framework to help us. 

Unity3D is excellent game engine. It has countless plugins to speed up your game develop.  However, using Unity3D to develop game is flexibleand it has many different ways: you can just use MonoBehaviour or Scene to construct a game, or use code purely, or other thounsands ways.

In short, no integrated solution to develop Unity3D game.

CosmosEngine is a try to solve this problem. Its style is a develop solution of pure code.


## Quick Start

CosmosEngine is weak now, no enough documentation support to it.
